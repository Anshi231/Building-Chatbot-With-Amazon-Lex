Amazon Lex is an AWS service for building chatbots and voice assistants with natural language understanding and speech recognition. It enables scalable, multi-platform conversational interfaces, integrates with AWS services, and offers cost-effective, dynamic interactions.

In today’s project, I used Amazon Lex to build a dynamic chatbot from scratch. I defined intents, added sample utterances, and configured responses. With Lex’s NLU capabilities, the chatbot understands user queries and provides accurate, conversational replies!
